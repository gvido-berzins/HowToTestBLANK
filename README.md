# How do I test <BLANK>?

There probably has been this question, which unanswered could lead to no tests
written at all, because it is easier to not just do it.

If it's not clear how to test something, it might be logical to find a project that
is solving a similar problem and checking how that project tests its code.

Tests don't need to be complicated, you don't need a test data generator to get
things done, for example, testing if a static site generator is working as expected,
there could be a small test which checks if the expected paths exist, or save a
valid output of the directory tree to test data and compare both, it doesn't need
to take too much work to implement such test cases.

I hope I can answer questions like these properly.
